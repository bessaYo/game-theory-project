# Peer-to-Peer Electricity Trading Simulation

This project was part of the Game Theory course at TUHH.
This project was developed as part of the Game Theory course at the Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH). Our implementation reconstructs the simulation model discussed in the paper:

[Peer-to-peer electricity trading in grid-connected residential communities with household distributed photovoltaic](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306261920311661) 

We have further enhanced the model by incorporating batteries with various storage and withdrawal strategies.

The data is based on a sunny day in Shanghai given by the paper.

To run the program:
```bash
python simulation.py
```

The simulation program generates various graphs based on key indices, including average price per unit, price dispersion, and social welfare within the community.
