# Peer-to-Peer Electricity Trading Simulation

This project was part of the Game Theory course at TUHH.
Our implementation reconstructs the simulation model discussed in the paper "Peer-to-peer electricity trading in grid-connected residential communities with household distributed photovoltaic". 
We further enhanced the model by incorporating battaries with different storing/withdrawl strategies.
The data is based on a sunny day in Shanghai given by the paper.

To run the program:
```bash
python simulation.py
```

The simulation program generates various graphs based on key indices, including average price per unit, price dispersion, and social welfare within the community.
